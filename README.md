Title: Using Machine Learning Ensemble Algorithms to Classify Biological Entities 
Project Purpose: The overarching purpose of this project is to find ways to more accurately predict patient outcomes based on RNA expression profiles related to human disease. In this part of the project, a combination of machine learning algorithms will be created and tested using various biological datasets. 

Find 4 more datasets from here: https://epistasislab.github.io/pmlb/ Focus on datasets with 2 class. Get a variety of dataset types...for example, many rows, not many columns; many columns, not many rows; many rows and columns.
